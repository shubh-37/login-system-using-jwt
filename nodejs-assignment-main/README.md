# Assignment Details

1. Please fork this repository and follow Project setup instructions listed below to install it locally.
2. Copy of a user should be stored in DB, you can use any database for this, our preference is MongoDB. 
3. Please create an endpoint called `/create-account`
4. It should take email and password and registers with some basic validation like
    - Proper email
    - Email shouldn't already exist
5. Store this data in user table. Make sure to encrypt the password. 
6. Please create an endpoint called `/login`:
 - It should follow the simplest login method, if I give correct email and password, it will return me a JWT Token. Wrong credentials will result in an error. 
 - Please don't use passport JS or any assisting libraries. 
7. Please create an endpoint called /dashboard, this will be an authenticated endpoint, if I don't pass a valid JWT Token it will return a 401. Else a 200 with some message.
